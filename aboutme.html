    <p>My favorite thing to do is eat and my favorite food to eat is plantain and egg. My friends call me Bella ohh sorry, BIG BELLA. I am a mass Communicator and a hair stylist, i do presenting also. Presenting is something i will choose first if we're talking about occupations. I've had a little bit of experience in presenting during my Tertiary education most people say i get more opportunities because, i have a nice voice which seemed to be true...... my other names are Oluwatomisin, Abike...</p>
